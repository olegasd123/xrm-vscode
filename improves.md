## XRM VS Code Extension — Improvement Ideas

- **Publishing ergonomics**
  - Offer a “Publish & Open in Browser” action that deep-links to the web resource record.
  - Support a “watch” mode to auto-publish on save for bound files, gated by a toggle.

- **Speed & efficiency**
  - Allow piping compiled assets: if the source is `.ts` or `.scss`, run the configured build task first and publish the generated output path.
  - Cache configuration/bindings in memory per session to avoid rereading JSON files on every command invocation.
  - Add a retry policy with exponential backoff for transient 429/5xx responses to reduce manual reruns.

- **Reliability & UX safeguards**
  - Add preflight validation: verify solution exists and remotePath uniqueness before uploading the content payload.
  - Provide clearer error surfaces: bubble up Dataverse error codes and correlation IDs, and show a “copy error details” button.
  - Let users choose whether missing web resources should be created per publish invocation (override the env default).
  - Add cancellation tokens to abort long-running folder publishes and surface partial results cleanly.
  - Support per-environment default solution overrides to avoid mispublishing to the global default.

- **Codebase improvements**
  - Wrap fetch with a typed client that enforces timeouts, consistent headers, and structured error objects; share across services.
  - Centralize OutputChannel formatting helpers and reuse logging code to avoid duplication and keep logs uniform.
  - Normalize remote paths in one utility (including case rules, trailing slashes) to reduce subtle mismatches.
  - Split `PublisherService.publish` into smaller units (resolve paths, acquire token, sync resource, publish) for easier testing.
  - Replace repeated `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` style parsing with Zod/io-ts schemas to validate `xrm.config.json` and `xrm.bindings.json`.

- **Security & compliance**
  - Avoid logging any part of tokens/credentials and mark secrets as `MaskedString` in telemetry when added later.
  - Allow configuring `resource` separately from `url` per environment to support sovereign clouds and custom apps.
  - Add an opt-in user agent (e.g., `XRM-VSCode/{version}`) so server logs can identify extension traffic.

- **Testing & tooling**
  - Add unit tests for path resolution, binding precedence, and publish branching (create vs update vs skip).
  - Introduce integration tests using mocked fetch responses to assert request shapes and error handling.
  - Wire up linting/formatting (ESLint + Prettier) and CI to guard against regressions before publishing the extension.
