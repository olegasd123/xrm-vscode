Initial scaffold for XRM VS Code extension created. Next up:

- [done] Wire real CRM publish logic inside `src/services/publisherService.ts`.
- Refine context menu to show separate "Add to {env}" vs. "Update and Publish to {env}" items once we have reliable per-item context detection.
- Add tests/linting once dependencies are installed.
